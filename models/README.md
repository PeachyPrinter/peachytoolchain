models
======

These are some simple models in STL and Blender format that we used during testing of the printer. Each was chosen to test various aspects of the printer, such as the ability to build square and true, building smooth features, and building complex objects. You may use these as a starting point for testing your own printer. Please avoid adding many more models to this directory and avoid adding models that you don't have rights to distribute and license.
