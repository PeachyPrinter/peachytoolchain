test files
==========

This is a collection of files used during testing and development.

* *drips_recorded.wav* -- An actual recording of drips measured from our drip sensor
* *drip_loop.wav* -- A hand-edited file with drip-like data, usable as fake data in place of a drip sensors. Can be looped.
* *drip_loop_fast.wav* -- Same as above, but running as fast as possible.
